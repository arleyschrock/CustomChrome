## Introduction

CustomChrome is a library to easy creating custom chrome (i.e. custom
form borders instead of the default Windows borders). It also provides
an implementation which imitates the Visual Studio 2012 chrome, including
the colored borders.

To use CustomChrome, add either the FormChrome component to a form if you
want to customize the chrome yourself, or the VisualStudioFormChrome
component if you want to use the Visual Studio 2012 chrome.

## Acknowledgements

The implementation of the FormChrome component is heavily based on
[http://customerborderform.codeplex.com/](http://customerborderform.codeplex.com/).
